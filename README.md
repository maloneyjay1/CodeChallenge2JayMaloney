JSON Parsing of large / flat source, UITableView UI

This was my second attempt at displaying data from a large source.  I retrieved asynchronously using MVC structure, and used an overall  master/detail design.

I completed it in 2 hours, and overall feel much better about this second attempt.  It made me think about the challenges of dealing with a variety of API's, and
how to deal with that in terms of loading UI elements.  I look forward to improving.

Also this was a great example of "keep it simple."  I initially tried using a complicated custom collection view and ended up not succeeding.
I'm very happy with this alternate approach.
